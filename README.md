# cpp-toys
This respository is just a collection of toy C++ programs that are created based on the examples and exercises from [Stroustrup, 2014](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/).

To run the programs on a Mac, you must specific the C++ standard of 2011 or later. I just use 2014. For example, to run hello_world.cpp. 

```
g++-5 -std="c++14" hello_world.cpp
```

Below is my C++ environment.

```
tg-dw021:toy_programs chris$ c++ -v
Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0
